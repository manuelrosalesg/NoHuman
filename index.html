    <h1>NoHuman</h1>
    <p>If you look at the 10 things most people are addicted in their computers,
        at least 9 of those ten has one of these two things in common:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Watching humans
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinite scroll
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        What im trying to build is the best way to remove those things from
        the computer, while still being able to use your phone for other
        things. Basicly not blocking a whole app, but the things that make
        the app addictive.
