    <h1>NoHuman</h1>
    <p>If you look at social media and porn adiction they have two things in 
        common:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Watching humans
        </li>
        <li>
            Infinite scroll
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        What im trying to build is the best way to remove those things from
        the computer, while still being able to use your phone for other
        things. Basically not blocking a whole app, but the things that make 
        people consumers rather than creators.
    </p>

        Anyone can colaborate to make a better product, and start helping 
        internet addicts.

        Free and open source.
